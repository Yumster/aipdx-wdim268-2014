I like th their simple and clean layout and it is easy to use. Usability is pretty well and they obviously think about what users do. Navigation is straight forward, again simple and clean. The amount of white space is just right. Clear hierarchy. 

Disable CSS: Basic. Still managable. I can difine sections. It is consistant throughout the site. I think there are variaties of h tags, and there still is a sense of hierarchy. Image sizes are random on the main page. I think the usage of listing is appropreate. 

Disable JavaScript: Navigation bars is not responsible with scroll. Over rapped parts on "Work" page. "News" page stays the same. "Blog" navigation option changed. Overall, few changes here and there but pretty much stays the same.

Typography - Sans-Serif, Times New Roman, Georgea

html - easy to spot what is what. Sections are clear. Why is JavaSpript is on the bottom?

JaveScript - I have no idea what each functions do but I recognized some for image, navigation, and dropdown ul.
