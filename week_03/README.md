I have chosen Yahoo Japan, because I visit this site everyday to get news. I am not crazy about the design of this site . I feel like they have navigations all over the place and it can be confusing if you visit this site for the first time. 

After I turned of CSS style, I see a lot of lists. I think they use <h> tags well to show hierarchy. I can see where new section starts. There aren't a lot of images, looks really plain. Overall, it is pretty basic. There are some border lines and boxes. Order is from left to right. 

After disabling JavaScript. I didn't see any noticable changes.
